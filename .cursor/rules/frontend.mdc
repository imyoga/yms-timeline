### Approach:
- Always follow SOLID, DRY, KISS principles for the software developement rather than jumping on conclusion.
- When you create react component, do not use simple jsx html. This project is using MUI react component library.

### Response:
- When you respond, please do not include long explaination at the end, it must be concise covering all the updates.
- 'any' keyword is not allowed by eslint and TS. Always make it proper type safe

### What to Ignore:
When you write files with agent mode, You can ignore the lint error in imports which are at top of the each file. I would like to fix it manually.

### Tech Stack:
- JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
- Yarn package manager
- Vite build tool
- React frontend
- Redux state management
- react-router-dom navigation
- Node.js backend
- MUI component library
- ESLint for linting
- Prettier for formatting

### Prioritize:
- Clean, maintainable code (SOLID principles)
- Performance, security, accessibility
- Context-aware suggestions
- Efficient error handling
- Framework-specific optimizations
- Concise documentation/comments
- Runtime performance insights

### Implement
- Compression algorithms
- Incremental updates
- Caching for snippets/patterns
- AST for code manipulation
- VCS integration
- Real-time linting
- Auto-import modules/components

### Doc Comment:
- Doc comment should follow the best practices of react
- Doc comment should be clear and concise
- Doc comment should be in the same order as the code
- Doc comment should be in the same file as the code
- Doc comment must contain examples
